# InterviewOS 🎯

> A full-stack recruitment and AI-powered technical interview platform enabling live video interviews, real-time collaborative coding, and automated candidate evaluation.

**Live:** [interviewos.online](https://interviewos.online)

---

## 📖 Overview

InterviewOS streamlines the technical hiring pipeline for interviewers and candidates — combining peer-to-peer video interviews, a collaborative live coding environment, multi-language code execution, and AI-driven interview prep and evaluation into a single platform.

Built for 100+ users across candidate and interviewer roles, with production deployment on AWS EC2.

## ✨ Features

- **JWT Authentication + OTP Email Verification** — secure sign-up/login with Redis-backed session management
- **Peer-to-Peer Video Interviews** — WebRTC + Socket.IO powered video rooms with sub-200ms audio/video latency
- **Live Collaborative Code Editor** — Monaco Editor with real-time bi-directional sync over Socket.IO; interviewers and candidates co-edit with zero lag
- **Multi-Language Code Execution Engine** — isolated code execution for 10+ languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, TypeScript, Go, and more), results delivered in under 2 seconds
- **AI-Powered Interview Prep** — real-time audio transcription with OpenAI-driven, role- and difficulty-tailored question generation
- **Automated Candidate Evaluation** — AI evaluator scores responses on accuracy, clarity, and relevance; generates performance reports in under 10 seconds
- **Recruiter Workflow Tools** — scheduling, application tracking, and messaging in one dashboard

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Key design decisions:**
- **Redis for session management** — reduces DB load and enables fast OTP/session lookups
- **WebRTC for peer-to-peer video** — avoids routing media through the server, keeping latency low and infra cost down
- **Socket.IO for code sync** — enables low-latency bi-directional updates for the collaborative editor
- **Isolated execution engine** — sandboxes untrusted code submissions per language runtime
